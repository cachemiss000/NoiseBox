Modifications made to the environment:

1. At the suggestion of https://dev.getsol.us/T5893 -
  * run CMD
  * navigate to your VLC folder (assuming "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC")
  * Run "vlc-cache-gen "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\plugins"

2. Protobufs are required for development. If you're working in Windows, you can download the "protoc" binary from
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases, and then place it on your path. You can then generate
the proto binaries required for the python files.
